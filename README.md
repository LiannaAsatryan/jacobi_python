#What this project does
 This project solves the given system of linear equations using jacobi method

#files
 in this directory there are following files
* input.txt __ it is the file where our matrix example is written like this

               |matrix |
               |_______|

* golden.txt __ it is the file where our correct answer is located
* matrix.py __ here is my matrix class
* jacobi_functions.py __ this file contains the functions which solve our main problem (jacobi and other related functions) 
* jacobi_test.py __ this file  contains the operation of the testing 
* main.py __ this file solves the main problem(without testing)
 the files that will be generated are 
*output.txt__here result-values are written
*result.txt__here test results are written(test passed or not)
*__pycache__(this directory is generated because I import the functions from a file into another)



#description
My project solves the system of linear equations using matrixes
if the given matrix isn't STRICTLY diagonally dominant, the answer is "no dominant"
If a letter is typed in place of number, or a wrong size is typed the answer is "wrong imput"
And finally, when our system has solution the answer is written like this   "sol1 sol2 sol3 ... soln"
NOTE: in my output file the solutions are written in 7 precision, in the golden file, 5 precision
